The code in this repository is based on [DeepSphere](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/DeepSphere) and regroups all experiments performed in the master thesis ["An empirical study of spherical convolutional neural networks"][thesis]. This master project was performed in the LTS2 lab at EPFL, during Spring semester 2019.

## Installation

For a local installation, follow the below instructions.

1. Clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Droxef/PDMdeepsphere.git
   cd PDMdeepSphere
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: if you will be working with a GPU, comment the
   `tensorflow==1.6.0` line in `requirements.txt` and uncomment the
   `tensorflow-gpu==1.6.0` line.

   **Note**: the code has been developed and tested with Python 3.5.

3. Play with the Jupyter notebooks.
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Experiments

The different benchmarks are regrouped in the [Experiment](Experiments) folder, and each has at least one notebook to rerun the experiment and reproduce the results in the report.
